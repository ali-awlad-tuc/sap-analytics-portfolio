# Predictive Analytics – Regression Model (SAP Analytics Cloud)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a regression-based predictive analytics model built in **SAP Analytics Cloud (Smart Predict)**.

The model predicts processor performance based on technical specifications such as core count, frequency, cache size, power consumption, and manufacturing process.
