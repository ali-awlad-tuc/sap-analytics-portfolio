# Predictive Analytics & Regression Modeling

**SAP Analytics Cloud – Smart Predict | Regression Scenario**

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a regression-based predictive model using SAP Analytics Cloud Smart Predict.

The objective was to predict a target KPI based on multiple influencing variables and evaluate model performance using statistical validation metrics.

The focus of this implementation was not only prediction accuracy but also model explainability and performance interpretation.

## 2. Modeling Approach

- Scenario Type: Regression
- Tool: SAP Analytics Cloud – Smart Predict
- Method Used: Automated Linear Regression
- Data Partitioning: Training & Validation Split
- Model Evaluation Metrics:
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  - Prediction Confidence
  - Validation Comparison (Predicted vs Actual)

---

## 3. Model Performance Evaluation

The model performance was assessed using:

- RMSE to measure prediction error
- Prediction Confidence to evaluate reliability
- Predicted vs. Actual comparison chart
- Training vs. Validation statistics
- Influencer contribution ranking

These metrics ensured transparency and statistical robustness of the predictive model.

---

## 4. Key Insights

- Identified the most influential variables affecting the target KPI
- Evaluated model accuracy using validation dataset
- Interpreted prediction intervals and error boundaries
- Compared predicted and actual values to validate reliability

The influencer contribution analysis provided explainability of the regression model, supporting data-driven decision-making.
