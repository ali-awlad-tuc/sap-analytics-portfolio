## Implementation Context

The solutions were developed within a structured SAP Analytics environment using enterprise-style business scenarios.

All dashboards, predictive models, and data configurations were independently designed and implemented to simulate real SAP project delivery standards.

The system environment was provided by erp4students for educational purposes.
