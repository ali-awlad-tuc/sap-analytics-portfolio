## About This Portfolio

This repository presents structured, enterprise-style SAP analytics implementations across reporting, planning, predictive modeling, and hybrid data architecture.

Each project simulates a realistic enterprise delivery scenario and follows layered architecture principles — from data acquisition to semantic modeling and executive analytics consumption.

The focus is on designing scalable, governance-ready analytics solutions within the SAP ecosystem.

# Architecture Principles Applied

Across all projects, the following principles were consistently applied:

- Layered architecture  
  (Source → Staging → Core → Semantic → Consumption)

- Clear separation between data modeling and reporting layers  

- Governance-aware configuration  
  (Validation, Versioning, Monitoring)

- Reusable and scalable modeling structures  

- Integration-ready design  

- KPI-driven business alignment
